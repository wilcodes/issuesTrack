# IssuesTrack 😠🗯

## Issues Track is going to be an Application that will allow to record and keep on track for issues with customers.

### My Idea goes around the need of companies to organize the issues that cannot be addressed at the moment.

### For that reason IssuesTrack will provide an easy Interface to add and edit issues in a dashboard where the most important details of each scenario or problem will be visible.

### I will add user authentication so that each user can be able to log in and track and record their issues or be able to access global issues within the group.

### The tools I will be using to build this project include:

- HTML5
- CSS  
- JavaScript
- Typescript
- React
- Styled Components
- Redux
- Firebase

### I will build the entire design of the project as well 👨‍💻

- Photoshop and MockFlow WireframePro for the design aspect
- Background pattern used by SVGBackgrounds.com
